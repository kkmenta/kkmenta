Through my self-portraits, I aim to capture the essence of my own being and reflect on my own journey through time. Each photograph is a reflection of my own experiences and emotions. Through my photography, I hope to offer a glimpse into my life as a scholar and adventurer, and inspire others to reflect on their own journeys through the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView the tutorial for this template (+ download link)"

    "text": "arXiv Preprint | Code\nOver the centuries, I have devoted countless hours to deciphering and translating the ancient scripts and dialects of the various peoples of Middle-earth. My goal is to gain a deeper understanding of the cultures and histories of these peoples by studying their languages. Currently, I am working on a monograph that explores the linguistic roots of the Elvish languages. Through extensive research and analysis, I hope to shed light on the connections between the different dialects of Elvish and their origins. This project has been particularly challenging, as Elvish is a complex and nuanced language, but I am determined to see it through to completion."

When I was training in crime scene investigation and preparing to testify in court, it was always said to talk and explain things to the jury at a 6th grade level. Yes, even complex scientific findings! By this time, I had become quite good at this, as the job I had before going into law enforcement was explaining state unemployment benefits and the ins and outs of the unemployment system in the state of Florida’s claimant call center. Being able to clearly explain complicated concepts is a skill that needs to be learned and used by all.\nWriting papers is hard. Writing papers explaining scientific concepts is even harder. From Jeffrey Leek’s “How to be a Modern Scientist”, the statement “Learn how to write papers in a very clear and simple style” struck a chord with me. Many people are suspicious of simple writing and can make others doubt the importance of the work you are hoping to publish. If no one reads the paper because it is written in extremely technical terms that only a niche group of people understand, then there is no point in writing the paper.\nWrite possible publications in a manner where you think most people can read and understand. You want to clearly communicate your results stemming from hours of research and/or experimentation. As Leek says, “Simple, clear language leads to much higher use/reading/citation/impact of your work”. The more people who understand your writing, the greater impact your writing can be to your community and the world at large."
