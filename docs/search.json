Through my self-portraits, I aim to capture the essence of my own being and reflect on my own journey through time. Each photograph is a reflection of my own experiences and emotions. Through my photography, I hope to offer a glimpse into my life as a scholar and adventurer, and inspire others to reflect on their own journeys through the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView the tutorial for this template (+ download link)"

    "text": "arXiv Preprint | Code\nOver the centuries, I have devoted countless hours to deciphering and translating the ancient scripts and dialects of the various peoples of Middle-earth. My goal is to gain a deeper understanding of the cultures and histories of these peoples by studying their languages. Currently, I am working on a monograph that explores the linguistic roots of the Elvish languages. Through extensive research and analysis, I hope to shed light on the connections between the different dialects of Elvish and their origins. This project has been particularly challenging, as Elvish is a complex and nuanced language, but I am determined to see it through to completion."
